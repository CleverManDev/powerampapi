	<!-- NOTE: while this approach works, it will fail for:
	- 2+line buttons (as they will overflow given space). Thus force such buttons to be short 1 liner
	- non-linear buttons (though I don't support these)
	? Do I really need that left aligned button at all? 
	! Material.io doesn't provide such use case and explicitly forbids right aligned 3rd dialog button
